Slightly Worse edition is a redesigned version of Kun fu Cuts Man's KFCMan's Adventure. (2019) It contains new level design, weapon rebalances, a new playable character, modified progression, a music mod, and other differences, making it significantly different from the source material.

You can play SWE by downloading the latest release and following the instructions to install the files in the correct place. 

You can install the music mod by adding the Music folder to the Mega Man Maker folder and replacing all files. If you want to uninstall the music mod, I have also included a folder also named Music in a folder named "original music backup" with the original music files. You can use the same method to bring back the original music files.

You can play the levels by adding the mmlv files in the installation's levels folder to Mega Man Maker's levels folder. You can find Mega Man Maker's levels folder easily by using the shorcut to the Levels folder in the Mega Man Maker folder.

You do not have to download the info files anywhere specific, they are files you can read from any location on your computer with a program that can read txt files such as Notepad. These provide additional information about the levels.
