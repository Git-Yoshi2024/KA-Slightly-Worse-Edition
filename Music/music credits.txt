--How Modification of Mega Man Maker Music works--

Mega Man Maker stores music in its Music folder. All music is stored as .nsf files. Mega Man Maker plays nsf files using the Gamemaker Studio extension Chiptune Player. When Mega Man Maker needs to play music, it directs Chiptune Player to play the correct nsf file, identified by its name and position in the files. By replacing the original nsf file with a different nsf file with the same name, Chiptune Player/Mega Man Maker will play the new nsf file in its place.


The NSF format is known as the NES Sound Format, the format used for music used for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  Chiptune Player can also play audio files from multiple other old systems. This means that by renaming a file from another supported format to use the nsf extension despite not actually being an nsf file, Chiptune Player/Mega Man Maker will play the file.

This folder contains multiple nsf files, already renamed and placed into the correct folders. To install the music mod, move this folder, titled "Music" into the Mega Man Maker folder and accept the prompt to replace all files.

You can uninstall the music mod using the same method and the "Music" folder in the "Original Music Backup" folder. You can also uninstall the music mod by updating or reinstalling Mega Man Maker.
