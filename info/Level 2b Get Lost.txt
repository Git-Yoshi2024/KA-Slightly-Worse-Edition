Based on the Minotaurr stage from KA. The level has good concepts that are more difficult to design than expected. Did you notice the 4 arrows before the maze that gave the answer?

The midboss was cut as part of the plan to reduce level 2 difficulty. Many bosses in KA included another boss above the arena. Most of these have been replaced with something else in SWE.

Completing this stage unlocks Charge Kick/Mino Charge. Given how important Charge Kick is, it was decided to make it one of the first two weapons unlocked. Thunder Claw is also important, but not as much.
