Clearly based on the Snivymaster1337 stage in KA. The first 2 Scloof RM stages are designed to be easier than the next 4. Part of this is done by only including 1 boss. Given this character's affinity for drones, I decided a battle wasn't worth it. The midboss would be the boss for this level, and you would "whip and leaf" at the end.

Completing this stage unlocks Thunder Claw/Vine Whip.
