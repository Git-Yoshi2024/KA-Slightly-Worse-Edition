Based on the Poisonous Gas stage in KA. If you see Moving Spike it's a sign I was having difficulty with the level design.

Level 3 contains the HARD letters, which are rooms containing letters protected by secrets and challenges. I recommend finding all HARD letters before playing the "level HARD"

Plant Man is weak to Ice Slasher. Tornado Man is weak to Crystal Eye. Defeating Poisonous Gas unlocks Black Hole Bomb/Poison Cloud.

You can find the letter A before the Boss Door at the end of the level. Pay attention to the Quicksand and look for a suspicious gap in the rock.
