Similar to Level 4, Level 5 is a combination of KA's Trashman and Scloof Fortress 2 stages. KA was made before Yellow Devil was added to Mega Man Maker, so it made its own Yellow Devil boss. After using Yellow Devil myself, I wonder if I should have done that too. This really is a Slightly Worse Edition.
