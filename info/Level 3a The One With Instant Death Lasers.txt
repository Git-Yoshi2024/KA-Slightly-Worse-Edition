This level is based on Mighty from KA. This isn't the first KA Mighty stage I have created. During the KA Construction challenge in 2021, I created the level Mighty Invasion. It did not age particularly well. Skull Man's AI just breaks now, turning a what was a very difficult boss into a joke. Not much was taken from that level in this one, although the Charge Kick path at the start was a great inspiration for the HARD letters. If you want to play it, you can find it on Mega Man Maker online, ID: 504745

Bosses are weak to Black Hole Bomb. Defeating Mighty unlocks Pharoah Shot/Mighty Shot

Level 3 contains the HARD letters, which are rooms containing letters protected by secrets and challenges. I recommend finding all HARD letters before playing the "level HARD"
