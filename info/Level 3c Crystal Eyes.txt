Based on TheCreativeEye in KA. This is the worst level in SWE. I had no ideas and got so desperate I turned it into a water level despite TheCreativeEye not being one. At least there was that color coded hint challenge.

Midbosses are weak to Pharoah Shot. Spring Man is weak to Ice Slasher. Defeating TheCreativeEye unlocks Crystal Eye/Creative Eye.

Level 3 contains the HARD letters, which are rooms containing letters protected by secrets and challenges. I recommend finding all HARD letters before playing the "level HARD"

The path to the A is in plain sight. Just use a Charge Kick jump to get to the ladder.
